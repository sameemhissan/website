### Framer Motion `Error`

The error occurs because `framer-motion@11.11.13` has a peerOptional dependency on React 18, while your project is using a release candidate of React 19. Framer Motion is not yet fully compatible with React 19, so npm is blocking the installation due to the conflict.

Here are ways to resolve this:

1. Use `--legacy-peer-deps Option`
   This option allows npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts, which should let you install Framer Motion with React 19:

```bash
npm install framer-motion@latest --legacy-peer-deps
```
